The contents of a concept module give the user descriptions and
explanations needed to understand and use a product.

-   Look at nouns and noun phrases in related procedure modules and
    assemblies to find the concepts to explain to users.

-   Explain only things that are visible to users. Even if a concept is
    interesting, it probably does not require explanation if it is not
    visible to users.

-   Do not include any instructions to perform an action, such as
    executing a command. Action items belong in procedure modules.

<!-- -->

-   A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the
    contents of the concept module.

-   Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links
    to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another
    assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
