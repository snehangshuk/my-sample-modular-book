*****************
Deploying Locally
*****************

As an backend develper, I want to deploy my multiproduct, so that I can fix issues before deploying to staging or production.

Prerequisites
*************

* Ensure that you have LinkedIn Engineering Tools installed.

* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this module.

* You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this module.

* Delete the section title and bullets if the module has no prerequisites.

Steps
*****

1. Start each step with an active verb.

2. Include one command or action for each step with the exception of simple follow-step, for example:

   2.1. Do this thing and then select **Next**.

   2.2. Do this other thing and then select **Next**.

3. Use an unnumbered bullet (\*) if the procedure includes only on step.

Verification Steps
******************

1. Start each step with an active verb.

2. Include one command or action per step.

3. Use an unnumbered bullet (\*) if the procedure includes only one step.

-   A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the
    contents of the procedure module.

-   Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links
    to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another
    assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
